# Dr. Semmelweis Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of handwashing on monthly death rates using historical data. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical tests to determine the significance of handwashing in reducing deaths.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that performs data analysis and visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets.
  - `annual_deaths_by_clinic.csv`: Yearly death data by clinic.
  - `monthly_deaths.csv`: Monthly death data.
- `images/`: Directory containing the generated images.
  - `Histogram_Monthly_Distribution_Outcomes.png`: Histogram of monthly death rate distribution.
  - `KDE_Monthly_Distribution_Outcomes.png`: Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot of monthly death rate distribution.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy plotly seaborn matplotlib scipy
python main.py
Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the yearly and monthly death data.
Visualization: Create histograms and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of death rates before and after handwashing.
Statistical Test: Perform a t-test to determine if the difference in death rates before and after handwashing is statistically significant.
Results
The results of the t-test are printed to the console, including the p-value and t-statistic. A small p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) suggests that handwashing had a significant effect on reducing deaths.
